# Art of Code:

## 📝Drawing with Code and Arting with Math 🧮

Welcome to the Art of Code project! This repository explores the fascinating intersection of art, mathematics, and programming. Here, we create visual masterpieces using algorithms, mathematical concepts, and code. I aim to:

- Demonstrate how code can be used as a creative medium
- Explore mathematical concepts through visual art
- Inspire both artists and programmers to think outside the box
- Make stuff and break stuff
